# Troubleshooting

This section contains common issues and how to troubleshoot them.

## Common issues

If you ingest documents and then run retrieval, but see the following
result

``` bash
Response: "I don't know"
```

Make sure that the request id in **both** config/init requests is the
same. If they are the same, then try reinitializing the context manager.

## Health Checks

Both services, ingestion and retrieval, provide health check endpoints
that can be used to verify service status:

```python
import requests

# Check Data Ingestion Service health
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8001/health")
print(response.text)

# Check Retrieval Service health
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/health")
print(response.text)
```

## Common Error Messages and Solutions

1. "Context manager not initialized"
   - **Cause**: Service not initialized or wrong UUID
   - **Solution**: Initialize both services with the same UUID

2. "No context was provided"
   - **Cause**: Documents not properly ingested or wrong UUID
   - **Solution**: Verify documents were added successfully and UUIDs match

3. "Invalid request format"
   - **Cause**: Incorrect JSON structure in request
   - **Solution**: Check request format against examples in the documentation

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Important Log Messages

1. Data Ingestion Service:
   - "Adding doc {index}" - Document being processed
   - "Batch {index} is full. Processing ..." - Batch processing
   - "start_pts or end_pts not found" - Missing timestamp metadata

2. Retrieval Service:
   - "Using {model} as the {type} llm" - Model initialization
   - "Setting up QnA, rag type: {type}" - RAG configuration

### Metrics

Both services expose metrics at `/metrics` endpoint:
- Request latency
- Document processing time
- Error rates
- System resource usage
